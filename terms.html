		<p><b>Transactions with Merchants; Advertisements and Offers:</b> The Services are a platform to connect Merchants with Consumers only. Valore Labs does not sell any merchandise directly, but instead facilitates the purchase transaction between you and a Merchant. You acknowledge and agree that Valore Labs is not a party to any transactions or agreements entered into between Consumers and Merchants. If you purchase any gift cards or other value-bearing instrument using the Service, you are contracting directly with the Merchant. Valore Labs is not a broker, agent or insurer, and has no control over the conduct of, or any pricing, policies (regarding use of Gift Cards, refunds, promotions or otherwise), or any other information or communication provided by a Merchant, and Valore Labs hereby disclaims all liability in this regard. Valore Labs does not endorse any Merchant, and we make no guarantee, explicit or implied, that any posted information is accurate. You agree that we are not responsible for any information or content provided by any Merchant, including typographical and other errors. We do not and cannot verify the information that Merchants supply, nor do we guarantee the services or products offered or sold through the Services. We assume no responsibility to verify whether the information of other content provided by Merchants complies with applicable laws; such responsibility rests with the Merchants. Any dealings that you may have with a Merchant through the Services is governed by the terms of the agreement that you enter into with Merchant, or Merchant’s applicable policies. We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the success of any transaction you have with that seller. You must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of the transaction.</p>

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.</p>
		<p><b><u>Termination</u></b></p>
		<p>You agree that Valore Labs, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Valore Labs believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Valore Labs may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Valore Labs may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Valore Labs will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
		<p><b><u>Arbitration</u></b></p>
		<p>At Valore Labs’ or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the Services that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Santa Clara County, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if Valore Labs changes this Arbitration section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Date of Last Revision” date above or in the date of Valore Labs' email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Valore Labs in accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>
		<p><b><u>User Disputes</u></b></p>
		<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and Valore Labs will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Valore Labs reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>
		<p><b><u>General</u></b></p>
		<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Valore Labs and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Valore Labs with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Valore Labs agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California. The failure of Valore Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Valore Labs, but Valore Labs may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
